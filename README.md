### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about software development in the areas of **web (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js)** and **AWS (web (fullstack -> amplify), serverless, event-driven architectures, media services)**. In my repo you can find contributions to various projects as well as some of my own projects.

This readme will also contain links to articles and other projects in the future.


The best way to reach me is LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickbichiou/

Greetings
Patrick
